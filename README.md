# DS-395-Statistics-and-Medicine
DS-395 explored COVID-19 vaccines through data science. Using R, we analyzed vaccine efficacy, long-term effects, and global vaccination rates. In our final project, we found younger groups had lower vaccination rates, Long COVID affects multiple systems, and higher GDP and vaccination rates correlate with higher post-pandemic life expectancy.
